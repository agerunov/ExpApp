##Public Expectations and Economic Growth in the EU
###Application Documentation

**1. Motivation and Data**

Economic expectations held by the public often have intricate connections to the overall economic dynamics. These expectations are usually asked in survey questions and national statistical institutes report a Balance indicator - by weighting and subtracting negative from positive responses. The balance is meant to show what the overall mood of the public is. If, for example, the balance of expectations about overall economic conditions is positive, this means that there are more people who expect that the economy will improve people who expect it will deteriorate.

The application lets you follow the dynamics of five kinds of expectations:

* Overall Expectations 

* Consumer Confidence 

* Industry Confidence 

* Service confidence 

* Unemployment Expectations


Those expectations will be compared to how the economy develops (real GDP growth) and see how closely expectations and actual dynamics move together. We look at **quarterly data for the European Union** ranging from the first quarter (Q1) of 1998 through the second quarter (Q2) of 2014. 

**2. Structure of the Application**

The Application is structured through a sidebar panel in which the use can input data, and a main panel which displays the results from the analysis.

As the user starts the application default settings are selected - it displays expectations about Overall Conditions against economic growth, and data is smoothed through a Linear Model (least squares) Smoother. The application begins with a short introductory paragraph with motivation. Right below, it outlines what input is selected and what is the correlation between the given type of expectations and economic growth.

It also features a graphical representation of the data via a scatterplot with a trendline to aid visual comprehension.

**3. Using the Application**

The user is encouraged to use input buttons to select the type of public expectations he or she would like to investigate. One can look at both the aggregated sample, or color the data points according to whether the data comes before the 2008 economic crisis, or after it.

The user can also select the type of smoother the application should use, including:

* No smoother

* Linear Model

* Robust Linear Model

* Loess smoother

An additional option allow the user to turn the standard errors of the Smoohter on or off.

**4. Concluding Remarks**

The current application can be used to easily track the dynamics of what the public expects and how it relates to what is actually happening in the economy. For this purposes it may be of use to policy-makers, educators in the field of economics and interested observers. While the visual and correlational analysis are only a first take at studying these phenomena, results shown may prove to be a useful first step.
